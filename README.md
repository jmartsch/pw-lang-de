# German language pack for ProcessWire

German (de_DE) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). Uses formal language ("Sie").

The repository will (try to) be up to date with the most recent **stable** version of ProcessWire. For use with a **dev** version, [look here](https://github.com/Manfred62/pw-lang-de/tree/dev).

Language packs for (some) older versions of ProcessWire are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/yellowled/pw-lang-de/releases) of this repository.
