# German language pack for ProcessWire

German (de_DE) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). 
Uses formal language ("Sie").

The repository will (try to) be up to date with the most recent **stable** version of ProcessWire.

Language packs for (some) older versions of ProcessWire are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jmartsch/pw-lang-de/releases) of this repository.

Big thanks to Matthias Mees and Nico Knoll for their initial work.

## Installation

To install a language pack, you must have the ProcessWire Language Support module installed. This is included with ProcessWire, so all you have to do is click to Modules > Language > Language Support > install.

### Install as additional language

Once you have Language Support installed, you can install this language pack by going to Setup > Languages > Add New Language. Enter a title and name for the language and save.

Next, you can install the files for the language pack. If your system supports ZIP uploads, you can simply drag the ZIP file for the language pack into the files field. If your system doesn't support ZIP uploads, then you'll want to unzip the language pack and drag the JSON files (as a group, or individually) into the files field. Save.

Now you can test out the new language by editing our profile and selecting the new language.

Menu items are translated after you log out and log in again.

### Install and replace the default language
With this installation type your ProcessWire admin would also be translated to the new language.

Horst Nogajski wrote a [great tutorial with screenshots](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/23627-change-default-language-to-be-none-english-walk-trough/) how to replace the default language.

In short it works like this (taken from Horst's writing):
1) enable languages support 

2) set title / label of the default language to your desired none english native language, (e.g. 'Deutsch' (German))

3) drop in the none english language pack (for admin backend) into the default language, (e.g. german langpack)

4) Now you are ready to start with a single language site of your choice.

5) If you want to use a multi language site
, you now can add as many additional languages you want. If one of them should be english, you add it, but do not need to apply a language pack.

    - add a new language to it and drop in a language pack for any none english language or simply don't drop in a language pack to get the english version (but not as the default one!)

For single language sites you only need to enable "ProcessWire Language Support". 

NOT language inputfields!

NOT language pagenames!

## Contribute to the language pack

You have discovered a spelling mistake? You have a suggestion for an alternative word? Or a translation makes no sense at all?

Great, then follow the instructions in the repo https://github.com/jmartsch/processwire-language-pack-helper

It comes with a full ProcessWire installation and allows you to easily update the translations.
