You must select a parent template (see: "allowed templates for parents" above). If more than 1 is selected, only the first will be used.|2. The selected parent template must have defined this template as one allowed for children.|Sort settings for children|If you want children to automatically sort by a specific field, select it here. Otherwise select "None" to let this be set per-page instead. This overrides the page setting, so if you select anything other than "None", the sort option will not appear for pages using this template.|More|Allow Page Numbers?|If checked, pages using this template will support pagination.|Should page number URLs have a trailing slash?|Allow URL Segments?|If checked, pages using this template will support custom URL segments after the page URL.|Should URL segments end with a trailing slash?|Which URL segments do you want to allow?|Enter one allowed segment, segment path or regular expression per line, or leave blank to allow any.|Should page URLs end with a slash?|If 'Yes', pages using this template will always have URLs that end with a trailing slash '/'. And if the page is loaded from a URL without the slash, it will be redirected to it. If you select 'No', the non-slashed version will be enforced instead. Note that this setting does not enforce this behavior on URL segments or page numbers, only actual page URLs. If you don't have a preference, it is recommended that you leave this set to 'Yes'.|Scheme/Protocol|HTTP or HTTPS|HTTPS only (SSL encrypted)|HTTP only|If your site has an SSL certificate and is accessible by HTTPS, you may make pages using this template accessible only via HTTPS or HTTP. For example, if you select 'HTTPS only' below, and a request for a page using this template comes in through HTTP, it will be automatically redirected to the HTTPS version. By default, ProcessWire allows connection from either HTTP or HTTPS.|Use Compiled File?|Enables ProcessWire to update your template file for the ProcessWire namespace and apply any installed FileCompiler modules.|Recommend at least for template files that do not use a ProcessWire namespace (like those originating from PW 2.x sites).|If you are not sure, choose "Auto".|(disables compiler)|Auto (compile when file has no namespace)|(template file only)|(template file and files included from it)|Detected template file namespace is "%s".|Compile recommended.|Compile not necessary unless needed for modules or includes.|Content-Type|Header to send with template file output.
